The quest for American citizenship is sort of a spiritual pilrigimage to the promised land, especially viewed through the eyes of an educated Indian who immigrated in the last decade. Holding that coveted passport opens many proverbial doors, doors with the promise of unlimited refills. For someone born in Asia, with an EB2 immigrant petition, the journey often involves a unique set of challenges, deeply rooted in bureacracy and prolonged uncertainity. 

As such, EB5 emerges as a tantalizing alternative with a simple capatilistic idea at its core -- $$$ in exchange for a green-card.
