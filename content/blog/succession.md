Over the course of the last decade, there have been incredibly few TV shows ([exhibit 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breaking_Bad), [2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veep)) that just suck you into their universe and occupy precious cerebral real-estate for weeks since you've watched it. Succession is one of those shows! 

The show revolves around the Roy family (loosely based on the Murdoch / Redstone family) and the drama surrounding the future of their family business. Over the last few weeks, I binged through the 26 episodes and tried to dissect why it is so refreshingly original:

- Most of the scenes in the show involve a group of folks just talking to each other. What’s unique is the wealth-porny backdrop (think jets, expensive NYC pent-houses), the fact the none of the characters on the show try to be likable or redeemable and the second-hand vicarious view into the lives of the 1%'ers.

- The dialogues are punchy, the number of subtle and droll jokes you'll hear per minute in Succession by far out-number any other dramas out there.

- Unlike other formulaic Netflix shows, Succession doesn’t try to end on a cliffhanger each episode. It avoids familiar trappings like flashbacks or establishing a character's motivation through a tedious back-story. Moral justification is rarely provided and in a smart move, the show leaves a lot to the user’s interpretation. 

There's just incredible room for analysis, and that's ultimately why I can't stop thinking about it.
