Now that my wife and I have stable jobs that we hope to continue for the atleast for the new few years, it's time to think about money. Money is a powerful tool -- which if you use correctly -- can provide you with utmost freedom and the capability to optimize my life around my personal values. This freedom can be in the form of being able to work in the field of your choice, or it can be the ability to work from anywhere you want without a set schedule.


After scouring plenty of books/blogs/podcasts on this subject -- full list below --, we've made a few radical changes that I list below; These resources has also made us think deeply about our long-term goals and what we want from life. I'm going to take this post to present our current financial thinking in depth.

## Budgeting

This is something that we started doing pretty recently using [YNAB](https://www.youneedabudget.com/). I personally gave YNAB a try when I was in Mumbai; but back then YNAB required frequent manual book-keeping (recording transactions, making sure everything is up-to-date) and was extremely US centric. YNAB is still mainly catered around needs of US residents but has added a plethora of features like automatic transaction syncing through Plaid, easier credit-card handling and more. 

### Why YNAB?

Admittedly, even after you setup your budget, YNAB does require a very hands-on involvement. And that's the one of the reason why I like YNAB - it forces us to spend more time thinking about how and where our money is spent. It's not a set-it-and-forget-it (cough cough Personal Capital and Mint) kind of financial service. YNAB puts you in control and makes you think deeply about our spending priorities. After using the service for ~30 days, what I love about YNAB is:
- You need to put every available dollar you've to work.
- Set explicit, time-constrained saving/spending goals
- Budget reports ([Toolkit for YNAB](https://github.com/toolkit-for-ynab/toolkit-for-ynab/) provides even more granular income and spending breakdown)
- Account Reconcilliation which forces you to go to cross-check balances


YNAB is expensive ($80/yr) and you can make a decent argument about how a good, strategic spreadsheet can do most of YNAB offers. But there two, good reasons why YNAB wins out:

1. Automatic, up-to-date transaction syncing
2. Easy to share most of the info with a SO
3. Convenient apps for phone, watch and the web!

With that said, I did encounter that on a few occasions, my Chase account syncing was delayed by over a week. There's also the fact that YNAB handles credit-cards in an unusual manner and it did take a signficant learning curve for me personally to figure it out!

## Asset Allocation

Given that we've no dependents, debt and are doing okay health-wise (touch wood), my SO and I can take a bit of risk. Just by looking at the pie-chart, I can see a few areas where can make signficant changes. Few things that're in the 2021 pipeline in the order of importance:

- Open a IRA (one of the reccomendations [from this book](/book-review-i-will-teach-you-to-be-rich/))
- Deviate more cash to ETFs/index-funds
- Dollar-cost average investments


### Bank Account Bonuses are meh

First Republic recently had $750 bonus if you open a new checking account, direct deposit your salary and maintain > $15K in balance for the over the course of 3 months. Back in November, this sounded like a great deal. Minimal effort and guarantee payout. However, on later introspection and reading a few books, I've realized I could have gotten a better ROI by investing the same money in ETFs/Index funds. Here's a contrived example:

Let's say I've $15K in principle and I earn about $3K in salary/month. To meet First Republic's bonus requirements, I need to maintain close to $30K of our liquid cash in their checking account for a period of 3-4 months. Let's assume I moved my principle and changed my direct deposit system to redirect to First Republic in November 2020. After about 3 months, my total share in the new checking account would be $30,750 ($30K + $750 bonus). 

Now if I had invested the same amount of the money in $AAPL back in November 2020, my portfolio would be up to $33K (up by 11%). The $750 bonus seems measly compared to this. Forget the real-estate market, forget the bank bonuses, forget the bonds; there's isn't a better wealth-building tool than the stock market. I chose $AAPL since it's a reliable stock but if I wanted to play it safe I would've go with SPY or ARK ETF.
