From Clayton Christensen's How Will You Measure Your Life:

> For many of us, one of the easiest mistakes to make is to focus on trying to over-satisy the tangible trappings of professional success in the mistaken belief that those things will make us happy. Better salaries. A more prestigious life. A nicer office. They are, after all, what our friends and family see as signs that we have "made it" professionally. But as soon as you find yourself focusing on the tangible aspects of your job, you are at risk of becoming like some of my classmates, chasing a mirage. The next pay raise, you think, will be the one that finally makes you happy. It's a hopeless quest.
