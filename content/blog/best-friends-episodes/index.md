description: Recapping our top 3 Friends episodes that we can rewatch again and again

We're on the verge of wrapping up re-watching F.R.I.E.N.D.S. When I initially watched the show in my late-teens, most of the show's appeal lied in the hilarious scenarios (Joey's a better actor when he drinks a lot of liquids), Chandler's sarcasm and the randy jokes. Now that I'm at an age closer to the characters in the show, I asked myself whether I can still watch it having been accustomed to slightly more mature, no studio audience or laugh-track based comedy shows. The answer to that question was a resounding Hell Yes. This is where I'm going to list my top 3 Friends episode based on a selective criteria grounded in on an episode's re-watchability, story arcs (i.e. all the arcs in the episode need to be equally good) and obviously the funny quotient.

#### 1. The One with the Embryos

This wasn't an easy-pick. There are two-story arcs i.e. one where Phoebe is trying to get impregnated and the other that involves a quiz between the rest of the group moderated by Ross.  Phoebe's arc in the episode works because of its sheer ludicrousness. I'm not in the "show-business" world but a sister carrying triplets for her brother is a batshit-crazy idea and wouldn't work unless for Lisa Kudrow's acting chops. However, the reason it's my #1 is because of the high-stakes quiz which presents **new**, funny information about the characters. You can feel that Rachel/Monica think highly of the apartment and consequently don't want to lose it, which leads to elevated laughs. The episode relies on the strength of the plot and its actors i.e. there's no need to introduce a crazy love interest for a character or a weird work-related conundrum. The "Miss Chanandler Bong" scene is clearly one of the best exchanges.

#### 2. The One where Everybody Finds Out

Ugly Naked Guy is moving out and Ross is interested in the apartment while Phoebe ends up finding out about Monica/Chandler's blossoming but secret relationship. There's a common theme between the plots for this episode & and my top-pick in that the friends are divided into two factions competing against one another. The one-upmanship ("They don't know we know they know we know"), Joey's irritability about this whole charade and the expert build-up to the tense finale where Chandler finally reveals his love for Monica make this a compelling episode that I can re-watch again and again. The reason why it's my #2 is this episode has a rather huge discrepancy. Why are two level-headed individuals fornicating in front of their window where everybody can see? Was this an homage to the Ugly Naked Guy or an instance of lazy writing or over-analysis on my part?

#### 3. The One with the Memorial Service

There' might be recency bias at play here, but this episode cracks me up. Ross and Chandler going back-and-forth writing ridiculous things on their college alumni website eventually leading Ross to organize a memorial service to see which of his high-school friends will show up is down-right hilarious. The other plot-line between Joey and Rachel concerning Hugsy is tight and equally hilarious. The episode was good because it banked upon previous story-lines (Chandler acting gay, Joey' fascination with Hugsy) while still exploring new scenarios.
