			<div>
				<h1> Can't see Clocker at all? </h1>
				<p> 
				If you're unable to see Clocker in your menubar, the most likely reason is because there's little space on the menu bar for Clocker to show along with Chrome 
				or other third-party app menus items (File, Edit, View etc) and your other menubar items (Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, Spotlight etc). 
				</p>
				<p>
				Third' party app menus take precedence over menu bar items (like Clocker) causing macOS to hide Clocker that would otherwise occupy that space. 
				To get rid of the blank issue, hereâ€™s what we suggest:
				<ul>
				 <li> Limit the number of Clocker menubar time zones to 2 to 3. Only select the timezones you really want. Use the Clocker panel for the rest of the time zones. </li>
				 <li> Remove unused menubar apps from your menubar to make space for Clocker </li>
				 <li> Increase your screen resolution </li>
				</ul>
				</p>
			</div>
		</Layout>
